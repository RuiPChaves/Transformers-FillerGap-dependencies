Bert_Agreement.zip contains additional experiments, in which the original items are embedded in more complex structures. 

In Experiment 1 the NPs have 3 to 4 words, and BERT's ability to keep track of the filler-gap dependency downstream is unaffected.
In Experiment 2 the NPs have 5 to 15 words, and BERT's ability to keep track of the filler-gap dependency downstream is hampered.
