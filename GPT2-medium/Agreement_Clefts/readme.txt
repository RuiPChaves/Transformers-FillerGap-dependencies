The NewExperiment.zip file contains two additional experiments, analogous to the extra experiments in BERT's cleft experiments folder.

- Experiment1 embeds the items in clauses with relatively short subject NPs. GTP2's accuracy remains excellent.
- Experiment2 embeds the items in clauses with relatively large subject NPs. GTP2's accuracy remains excellent, unlike BERT's.
